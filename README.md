# Black Jack - The Game 

The Blackjack project is a WinForms version of Blackjack coded in C# using the .NET framework. 

# How To Play
The game allows a single player to play against the virtual dealer and make bets with their starting balance of $1,000. The game ends when the player either loses all of their money or decides to cash in (and close the application).
